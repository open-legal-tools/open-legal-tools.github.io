title: Oak - Multi-pane Document Workspace
---

# Oak

Oak is a powerful multi-pane document workspace that enables efficient navigation and comparison of multiple documents. It serves as the foundation for our legal tools while being useful for any knowledge worker who needs to work with multiple documents simultaneously. 

## Current Status

Oak is in early development. We're focusing on establishing the core document viewing and workspace management capabilities.

## Key Features (Planned)

- Multi-pane document viewing with independent scrolling
- Dynamic workspace management
- PDF rendering and navigation 
- Folder monitoring with cloud storage compatibility
- Workspace memory (saving/restoring layouts)
- Intrafolder search across documents
- Accessibility features and screen reader compatibility

## Development Approach

We're building Oak incrementally in small, focused development sessions, documenting our progress in the [Captain's Log](../captains-log.md).

## Technical Foundation

- Electron + React for cross-platform desktop experience
- PDF.js/PDFium for document rendering
- Golden Layout for pane management
