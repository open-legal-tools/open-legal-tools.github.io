---

# Gavel

Gavel is a sophisticated legal document navigator built on the Oak workspace platform. It adds legal-specific enhancements that transform how judicial clerks and other legal professionals interact with case documents. 

## Current Status

Gavel is in planning and early design, as we first establish the Oak foundation.

## Key Features (Planned)

- Automatic citation detection and linking
- Legal-specific document workflows
- Court document navigation enhancements
- Citation validation and verification
- Legal research tool integration
- Indiana appellate-specific optimizations initially

## Initial Focus

Our initial focus is on supporting the workflow of judicial clerks at the Indiana Court of Appeals, with plans to expand to other jurisdictions and legal professionals over time.

## Technical Approach

Gavel extends Oak with legal-specific functionality, building on the solid foundation of the core document workspace.
