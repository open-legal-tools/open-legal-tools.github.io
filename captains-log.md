# Captain's Log

Follow our development journey through regular updates on what we're building and what we're learning.

## 2025-03-13: The Birth of Oak and Gavel

Today marks an important architectural decision in our project. Rather than building a monolithic application, we're separating our work into two distinct but connected projects:

1. **Oak** - A core multi-pane document workspace useful for any knowledge worker
2. **Gavel** - A legal-specific extension built on Oak for legal professionals

This separation gives us several advantages:

- Cleaner architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Ability to focus on getting the document workspace fundamentals right before adding legal-specific features
- Potential for Oak to be useful beyond the legal domain
- More focused development in our limited 15-minute development sessions

We've created our GitHub organization and initial repositories, and we're excited to begin building in the open.
