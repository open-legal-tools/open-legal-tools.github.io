# Our Vision

## The Law Wants to Be Free

The law itself is an output of democratic processes; it belongs to everyone. Yet today, legal information remains difficult to access and navigate, often hidden behind paywalls or trapped in formats that inhibit understanding.

## The Conversation of Law

Appellate cases applying and developing the law are part of a conversation that has been ongoing for generations and will continue long into the future. These cases should be freely accessible and maintained like a public park or digital library for anyone to explore.

## Building Pathways to Understanding

Having access to legal documents isn't enough without the tools to navigate and understand them. We're building these pathways â€“ tools that make legal information accessible, navigable, and comprehensible for everyone, regardless of legal training.

## Starting with Those Who Need It Most

We begin by serving judicial clerks - the legal professionals in the trenches who review appeals, navigate complex case documents, and draft opinions. By making their work more efficient, we help them be even more effective in serving the public.

## A Platform for Accessibility

While we start with judicial clerks, our vision extends to all who interact with the law - judges, attorneys, pro se litigants, students, researchers, business owners, teachers, parties to cases, and the general public. By building a solid foundation with thoughtful, modular design, we create a platform that can grow to serve everyone.

## Open by Design

We're committed to open-source development not just as a licensing choice, but as a philosophy. The tools to access public information should themselves be public, transparent, and collaboratively maintained.
